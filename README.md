# Download Image in Rust ðŸ¦€

This Rust project demonstrates how to download an image from a URL and save it to your local file system. It utilizes various Rust crates for HTTP requests and file handling.

## Crates Used

- [tempfile](https://crates.io/crates/tempfile): A crate for working with temporary files and directories.
- [error-chain](https://crates.io/crates/error-chain): A crate for creating custom error types and handling errors gracefully.
- [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest): An HTTP client for making web requests.
- [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio): A runtime for writing asynchronous code in Rust.

## Importance

This project showcases how to download and save images from the internet in a Rust application. It's valuable for developers looking to automate image retrieval or implement web scraping with Rust.

## Setting Up and Running Locally
